# Jetson Object Detection

This Project allows you to detect objects via a Camera. It marks how certain it is that an object is an object. For example, if it was shown a human, it would *for example* be 96% certain that its a human.


## Running this project

*1.* First, download the python file and run it on your Jetson Nano. *(make sure a camera is connected!)*
*2.* Have everything connected.
*3.* See this project in action!
